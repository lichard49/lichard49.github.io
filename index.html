        <h1>Education</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I'm a senior graduating in May 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, with concentrations in <a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/colleges/coc/ugrad/comsci/threads/degreq/devices-intel.php">devices and artificial intelligence</a>.  I'm also pursuing a clarinet performance music minor</p>

        <h1>Industry</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>My latest experience was as a Software Development Engineer internship at Amazon.com building <a href="http://www.amazon.com/warranty/WarrantyFinder/">Protection Plan Finder</a> from scratch (and it was launched!).  I previously held internships at Intel and Broadcom.</p></div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h1>Teaching</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I have an interest in teaching not just the next generation, but also the current one.  I co-found and co-lead Georgia Tech's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gttechintprep/">Technical Interview Preparation</a> organization.  I'm also the former technical lead of <a href="http://hackgt.com/">HackGT</a> and helped put on two iterations of the hackathon which I believe were major learning opportunities for the Georgia Tech community.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h1>Research</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>My research interests are in mobile, wearable and ubiquitous computing.  I have been in the <a href="http://acmelab.gatech.edu/">ACME Lab</a> for the majority of my undergraduate career working on Tactile Teacher.  More recently, I joined the <a href="https://research.cc.gatech.edu/ccg/">Contextual Computing Group</a> working on several cool projects.</p>
