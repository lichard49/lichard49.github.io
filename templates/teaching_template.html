        Embedded systems capstone is a project-based course for senior-level undergraduate students and masters students in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science.
        I prepared and taught lectures on advanced embedded systems topics including PCB design, wireless communication, and on-device machine learning.
        In addition to lectures, I also ran lab sessions and guided 9 team projects from ideation to final presentation.
